# Retention Analysis
The main goal of this project is to analyze customer retention on a fictional website â€” specifically, how well we retain users over time and how they continue to engage with our product and services.

This analysis helps us understand customer behavior, evaluate engagement over time, and identify areas where retention is strong or where improvements are needed. It also provides insight into potential issues or drop-off points that may require deeper investigation.

## Files
In the files section, you can find: 
- a .txt file, containing the code used to extract, clean, and calculate the retention data.
- an Excel file, that includes graphs and visual insights that help draw conclusions and highlight opportunities for improvement.
